# My Developer's Configuration

## Usage
- Clone this repository
- run the `install.sh` script (might need to give permissions with chmod)
- fix things along the way, because it's probably pretty broken

## Known Issues and TODOs
- XClip based Clipboard provider is not striping `\r` from the ends of lines when pasting
- Get good at vim
